A/B testing
>It was worth it. Based on the sample of images I worked on, the GoogLeNet classification error turned out to be 6.8% (the error on the full test set of 100,000 images is 6.7%). My own error in the end turned out to be 5.1%, approximately 1.7% better. If you crunch through the statistical significance calculations (i.e. comparing the two proportions with a Z-test) under the null hypothesis of them being equal, you get a one-sided p-value of 0.022. In other words, the result is statistically significant based on a relatively commonly used threshold of 0.05.
