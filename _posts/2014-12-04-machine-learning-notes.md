Some notes from the [ML Coursera class](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml), taught by Andrew Ng.

## I. Introduction (Week 1)

### Supervised learning

Supervised learning means that the algorithm know the "correct" outputs.

Regression problem: when the outputs have continuous values. Example: Housing price vs Housing size.

Classification problem: whent the output have discrete values. Example: Tumor size vs benign or malignant.

### Unsupervised learning

In unsupervised learning, the algorithm has no idea what is a "correct output". Its challenge is then to try to find a structure in the data.

Clustering: data are grouped inside separated clusters. Example: Google News related articles.
Cocktail party algorithm. Example: Separation of two sounds played together.

## II. Linear Regression with One Variable (Week 1)

Definitons: a function $$h$$ (for hypothesis) maps from input variables $$x$$ to output variables $$y$$. Couple $$(x, y)$$ are training example (from the training set).

Here, $$h$$ is a linear function: $$h_\theta (x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$$. $$\theta_0$$ and $$\theta_1$$ are the parameters. To find the best model is to find the parameters that minimize the sum of the squared difference between $$h_\theta (x^{(i)})$$ and $$y^{(i)}$$. The cost functiom is then the squared error function.
