Because it's better if you have all the vocabulary you need into a single place.

* ## [Convolutional Neural Network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)

  *Convolutional Neural Networks* are a type of artifical neural network used in deep learning, especially for image recognition.

* ## [Data munging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling)

  *Data munging* or *data wrangling* is the process of cleaning data from one "raw" form into a structured, purged one.

* ## [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/)

  *DataKind* is a nonprofit that connects organizations and data scientists who volunteer to help them understanding their data. 

* ## [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/)

  *Hive* is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop for providing data summarization, query, and analysis. It was initially developed by Facebook.

* ## [Julia](http://julialang.org/)

  *Julia* is a programming language designed for scientific computing and [approaching the performance of C](http://julialang.org/benchmarks/). Its syntax is [close to MATLAB](https://github.com/lakras/matlab-to-julia).

* ## [MetricsGraphics.js](http://metricsgraphicsjs.org/)

  *MetricsGraphics.js* is a graphic library build on top of D3 optimized for plotting time-series data. It was created by people from Mozilla. See some examples [here](http://metricsgraphicsjs.org/examples.htm).

* ## [Plotly](https://plot.ly/)

  *Plotly* is an online data visualization platform. It was built using Python and the Django framework, with a front end using JavaScript and the visualization library D3.js.
  
* ## [Recurrent Neural Network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)

  *Recurrent Neural Networks* are a type of artifical neural network used in text analysis and natural language processing.
