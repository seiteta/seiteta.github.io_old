My notes from the [Designing RESTful APIs class](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud388/), taught by Lorenzo Brown on Udacity.

## 03 - What are APIs

APIs are Application Programming Interfaces. They refer to any method of communication between two entities of code.
APIs are connection points in code that allow one application to talk to another.

APIs are a great way for controlling the exposure of code, allowing internal functionalities of an application to be used from the outside world without exposing all of the internal code.


##  04 - Web APIs

Web API's make it possible to invoke the execution of code on another machine via the Internet.

A machine can use multiple web APIs to create a new application,sometimes called a Mashup, providing users with a new experience that leverages existing applications.


## 07 - Web API Protocols

A set of rules must be in place in order for machines to speak the same language: protocols.

A common abstraction : the open systems interconnection (OSI) model and its 7 layers:

7. Application layer
6. Presentation layer
5. Session layer
4. Transport layer
3. Network layer
2. Data link layer
1. Physical layer


## 08 - Digging into The Application Layer

Sitting on top of these layers is the application layer. This layer is responsible for setting all of the protocols in which applications exchange data.

The most popular application level protocol is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP. HTTP functions via a series of requests and responses between clients and servers respectively.

Other popular application level protocols: FTP, IMAP, SSH, and POP.

Two more layers "web service" and "message formatting".
